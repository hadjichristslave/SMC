Sequential monte carlo method for dependent Dirichlet process.
The sampler is based on the paper as found in http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v33/neiswanger14.pdf.

The model is similar to that as the sampler is created to cluster point clouds rather than pixels.

Still work in progress, updated daily.
